# Welcome
This is my first attempt at building a timed trivia game with multiple choice options.

## Usage
Essentially, this game uses basic JS and jQuery to taka a question bank and push out multiple choice answers that can be tallied before the clock runs out.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, along with any feedback, thanks!
